    question: "Who is DOGM.AI for and what backgrounds thrive?",
    answer:
      "Ambitious builders, designers, analysts, operators, and solo professionals who already create value but want to become the AI-native person on their team. We coach career switchers, upskill in-role talent, and support founders who need high-output systems.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need prior experience or a portfolio to join?",
    answer:
      "No formal prerequisite is required. You bring curiosity, discipline, and 6+ hours a week. We supply structured foundations, AI copilots, mentor feedback, and execution templates that match your level whether you're a beginner or already senior.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do the bootcamps actually run week to week?",
    answer:
      "Every week is an outcome loop: daily AI-guided sprints, live or async mentor checkpoints, and a tangible artifact you publish. You plan on Monday, ship by the weekend, and use feedback/analytics to tighten your playbook for the next cycle.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the realistic time commitment?",
    answer:
      "Expect 6–10 focused hours per week for 6–12 weeks. Most learners spend 45–60 minutes per day on sprints, then stack a longer session for project delivery. Optional advanced challenges, office hours, and partner events can add more time if you choose.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I receive a certificate or credential when I finish?",
    answer:
      "Yes—you earn a verified DOGM.AI credential tied to your shipped work. More important: you graduate with 3–5 portfolio artifacts, a public mastery narrative recruiters can verify, and continued access to the system for your next skill climb.",
